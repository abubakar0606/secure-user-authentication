 **Secure User Authentication System**

 **📌 Project Overview**
This project focuses on strengthening user authentication and protecting sensitive
user data by implementing modern security mechanisms. The goal of this task is to
understand how real-world applications secure user accounts against unauthorized access.

This task was completed as **Task 3** of the **Cybersecurity Internship at Internee.pk**.


 🎯 **Objectives**
The main objectives of this task are:
- To strengthen user authentication using Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
- To implement secure login using OAuth 2.0
- To protect sensitive user data using strong encryption (AES-256)
- To safely test authentication mechanisms using fake user data


 🔐 Security Features Implemented

1️⃣ **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**
Two-Factor Authentication was implemented using **Google Authenticator**.
After entering a username and password, users must provide a time-based one-time
password (OTP) generated by the authenticator app. This adds an extra layer of
security and prevents unauthorized access even if passwords are compromised.


 2️⃣ **OAuth 2.0 Authentication**
OAuth 2.0 was used to enable secure and seamless user sign-in.
Users can authenticate using third-party providers (such as Google) without sharing
their passwords with the application. Instead, access tokens are used to grant
temporary and limited access.

This approach improves both security and user experience.


3️⃣ **AES-256 Encryption**
Sensitive user data such as passwords and authentication tokens were protected using
**AES-256 encryption**. AES-256 is a strong symmetric encryption algorithm widely used
in enterprise and cloud environments.

Encryption ensures that even if data is exposed, it remains unreadable to unauthorized users.


 4️⃣**Fake User Data (Safe Testing)**
To avoid using real user data, fake user datasets were generated using **Mockaroo**.
This allowed safe testing of authentication features such as 2FA, OAuth login, and
encryption without risking privacy or data exposure.


 🧪 **Tools & Technologies Used**
- Google Authenticator (2FA)
- OAuth 2.0
- AES-256 Encryption
- Mockaroo (Fake User Data)

**📌 Conclusion**
This task provided practical exposure to real-world authentication and data protection
techniques. By implementing 2FA, OAuth 2.0, and AES-256 encryption, this project
demonstrates how modern applications secure user identities and sensitive information.

Overall, this task helped strengthen understanding of authentication systems and
security best practices used in professional environments.
